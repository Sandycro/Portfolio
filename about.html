        <h1>Hi and thank you for visiting my site</h1>
        <p>As a part of a career change I have recently decided to join intensive 9 week coding bootcamp Le Wagon to dive into coding. I graduated from the University of Gloucestershire with a Master of Business Administration (MBA in Hospitality) and I previously worked in a number of admin/custom service roles. Being passionate about technology and wanting to further develop my skills and gain valuable experience I have decided to learn full-stack development. I have started the Le Wagon course in April and in the past 9 weeks we focused on Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, relational DB design, and deploying a product on Heroku. I am a lifelong learner and an enthusiastic believer that great things do not come from within the comfort zone. With this intensive course I gained new skills adapted to new daily challenges and learned new programming languages.</p>
